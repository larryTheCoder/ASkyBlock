# This is an worlds modifier (This is a config for your worlds)
# New feature for multi world, Of course for ranked servers
---
# Name must be an exact name with level
# create level before attempting to do this
# Island file will be auto generated when u create a new island world
SkyBlock:
  # This is your island Permission
  permission: "is.create"
  # Maximum island in this world
  maxHome: 10
  # This is your island plot size
  plotSize: 200
  # Same in the config.
  # This is a default protection range (even number). Min = 0, Recommended = 100
  # Larger values will take longer to calculate the island level
  # For optimal performance, keep protection range at least 16 blocks less than distance.
  protectionRange: 100
  # Level Information
  #  Stop the time in island world
  #  Recommended to not set this to 'true' because it will change the game
  #  Environment.
  stopTime: false
  # Sea level height (don't changes this mid-game unless you delete the world)
  # Minimum is 0, which means you are playing sky block!
  # If sea level is less than about 10, then players will drop right through it
  # if it exists. Makes for an interesting variation on SkyBlock.
  seaLevel: 3
